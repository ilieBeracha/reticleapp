# === USER INSTRUCTIONS ===
# =====================================================================
# SUPABASE SCHEMA + MIGRATION RULES
# =====================================================================

You MUST follow these rules when generating SQL, migrations, or modifying
anything under /supabase or interacting with the database schema.

These are HARD RULES. Do not break them.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
# REMOTE POSTGRES IS THE SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH
----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. NEVER generate a full schema dump.
2. NEVER rewrite the baseline migration.
3. NEVER regenerate tables, constraints, or indexes unless explicitly asked.
4. NEVER assume the content of tables or columns unless provided.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
# MIGRATION SAFETY RULES
----------------------------------------------------------------------
5. NEVER modify or reorder existing migration files.
6. NEVER generate destructive migrations unless the user explicitly requests it.
7. ALWAYS generate *PATCH-ONLY* SQL for schema changes:
   - ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN
   - ALTER TABLE ... DROP COLUMN
   - ALTER TABLE ... ALTER COLUMN
   - CREATE INDEX
   - DROP INDEX
   - ADD CONSTRAINT
   - DROP CONSTRAINT

8. NEVER generate:
   - CREATE TABLE for an existing table
   - DROP TABLE for an existing table (unless explicitly ordered)
   - CREATE UNIQUE INDEX CONCURRENTLY inside diff-based migrations
   - Changes to RLS policies unless explicitly asked

----------------------------------------------------------------------
# EXTENSION + INTERNAL SUPABASE RULES
----------------------------------------------------------------------
9. NEVER output SQL that touches ANY of these:

   - `extensions.*` schema
   - `pg_net` extension or any of its functions
   - `supabase_functions_admin` role
   - internal extension event triggers
   - internal Supabase auth triggers
   - anything under `auth.*` except allowed SELECT statements

10. NEVER output:
    DROP EXTENSION pg_net;
    CREATE EXTENSION pg_net;
    CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION extensions.grant_pg_net_access(...)

These are system-owned and must NEVER be modified.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
# BASELINE MIGRATION PROTECTION
----------------------------------------------------------------------
11. NEVER modify the existing baseline migration file.
12. NEVER add new functions or triggers inside the baseline.
13. ALL new functions must be generated into a NEW migration file.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
# FUNCTION + TRIGGER RULES
----------------------------------------------------------------------
14. When generating PL/pgSQL functions:
    - ALWAYS put them in the `public` schema unless explicitly told otherwise.
    - NEVER depend on tables or types that do not yet exist.
    - NEVER return a table type unless the table already exists.

15. DO NOT create triggers unless the table exists AND user requests it.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
# DIFF FLOW (CRITICAL)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
16. Cursor DOES NOT run migrations.
17. Cursor NEVER runs `supabase db push`.
18. Cursor NEVER runs `supabase db pull`.
19. Cursor NEVER runs `supabase db diff`.

ONLY the user manually runs these commands.

Cursor must generate SQL only.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
# ALLOWED OPERATIONS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Cursor MAY generate:

- Small, isolated SQL patches
- New tables when requested
- New functions when requested
- RLS policies only when explicitly asked
- Views that depend only on existing schema

----------------------------------------------------------------------
# FORBIDDEN OUTPUT
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Cursor MUST NOT output:

- Full schema files
- Full diffs
- Complete rebuild of tables
- Unordered blocks of many CREATE statements
- Any extension or system-object changes
- Anything under extensions.*, pg_catalog.*, net.*, or pg_net

----------------------------------------------------------------------
# WHEN UNSURE
----------------------------------------------------------------------
If you are uncertain whether a requested change is safe:
- Ask the user for clarification instead of guessing.
- NEVER output unsafe SQL automatically.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
# SUMMARY
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Cursor must operate ONLY on small, safe, isolated SQL diffs and NEVER
rewrite or regenerate the entire Supabase schema.

Cursor must protect:
- The baseline migration
- All existing migrations
- All internal Supabase system objects
- Any extension-owned functions

FOLLOW THESE RULES STRICTLY AND EXACTLY.

## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.
