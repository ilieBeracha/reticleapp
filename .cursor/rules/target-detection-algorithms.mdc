Path: components/addTarget/DetectionEditor.tsx
- Coordinate mapping between original and display image spaces
- Manual and AI-detected bullet hole processing
- Confidence scoring system for detected hits
- Custom marker visualization with draggable correction

2. Target Analysis System (Importance: 90/100) 
Path: components/addTarget/ResultCard.tsx
- Group size calculations from bullet hole patterns 
- Multi-mode detection editing interface
- Shot pattern analysis and validation
- Target data submission pipeline

Key Detection Workflows:
- AI-assisted initial hole detection
- Manual correction and validation
- Coordinate space transformations
