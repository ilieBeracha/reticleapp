Bullet Hole Detection System (Importance Score: 95/100)
- Custom coordinate mapping between source image and scaled canvas
- Confidence scoring system for detected bullet holes:
  - Low confidence: 0.4 - 0.6
  - Medium confidence: 0.6 - 0.8 
  - High confidence: > 0.8
- Automated detection validation rules:
  - Maximum holes must not exceed rounds fired
  - Minimum distance between valid holes
  - Edge case filtering for false positives

Target Analysis Workflow (Importance Score: 90/100)
- AI-powered paper target scanning with hole detection
- Manual correction interface for detection adjustments
- Shot grouping analysis with:
  - Maximum spread calculation
  - Center point determination
  - Statistical outlier detection
- Distance-based scaling for real-world measurements

Detection Training System (Importance Score: 85/100)
- Collection of manual corrections for AI model improvement
- Validation workflow for detection accuracy
- Metadata tracking for detection quality metrics
- Training data submission pipeline for model updates

Performance Metrics (Importance Score: 80/100)
- Group size calculations for accuracy assessment
- Quality scoring tiers:
  - Excellent: < 5cm groups
  - Good: 5-10cm groups
  - Fair: 10-20cm groups
  - Poor: > 20cm groups
- Distance-adjusted scoring modifications
