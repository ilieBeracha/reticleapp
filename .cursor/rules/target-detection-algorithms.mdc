Target Detection Core Components:

1. Bullet Hole Detection Engine
Path: components/addTarget/DetectionEditor.tsx
- Implements specialized coordinate mapping between image and canvas space
- Processes detected bullet holes using AI-based image analysis
- Calculates group sizes and shot dispersions
- Supports manual override for AI detections
- Manages detection confidence scoring
Importance Score: 90

2. Shot Group Analysis
Path: components/addTarget/ResultCard.tsx
- Calculates group size measurements using extrema points
- Determines shot pattern characteristics
- Processes accuracy metrics based on target zones
- Handles different scoring zones for tactical vs paper targets
- Implements MOA calculations for different distances
Importance Score: 85

3. Target Classification System
Path: components/addTarget/TargetForm.tsx
- Differentiates between grouping and achievement targets
- Processes different scoring rules per target type
- Handles target orientation detection
- Manages target distance compensation
- Implements target-specific metadata validation
Importance Score: 80

4. Detection Confidence Scoring
- Assigns confidence levels to detected shots
- Implements threshold-based filtering
- Processes detection quality indicators
- Handles edge case detection scenarios
- Maintains detection audit trail
Importance Score: 75

Key Workflows:
1. Shot Detection Pipeline
- Image preprocessing and normalization
- Bullet hole identification
- Coordinate transformation
- Confidence scoring
- Manual verification interface

2. Group Analysis Process
