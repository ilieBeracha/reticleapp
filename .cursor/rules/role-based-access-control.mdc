# role-based-access-control

Military Hierarchy Permission System (Importance: 95/100)
- Core roles: owner, commander, squad_commander, soldier
- Strict hierarchical permission inheritance
- Squad-based access boundaries
- Role-specific training control capabilities
- Team workspace permission segregation

Training Access Controls (Importance: 85/100)
- Commander-level session management
- Squad-specific training visibility
- Role-based drill template access
- Training progression gates by rank
- Real-time permission enforcement

Workspace Authorization (Importance: 75/100)
- Team vs personal space segregation
- Role-dependent workspace features
- Organization-level permission inheritance
- Dynamic capability checking

File: components/organization/RoleInfoBanner.tsx
- Organization role messaging system
- Conditional workspace management permissions
- Instructor vs participant capability differentiation

File: components/BaseAvatar.tsx
- Hierarchical role visualization
- Role-specific color coding
- Team rank indicators

Core Permission Rules:
1. Owners have unrestricted access across teams
2. Commanders control training and member management
3. Squad commanders limited to their assigned squads
4. Soldiers access only assigned training sessions
5. Role elevation requires higher-rank approval

Role-Based Workflows:
- Training session creation (commander+)
- Squad member management (squad_commander+)
- Drill template access (commander+)
- Training participation (all roles)
- Performance analytics access (role-dependent depth)
