Military Hierarchy Permission System (Importance Score: 95/100)

Core Role Structure:
- owner: Full system access and organizational control
- commander: Training program management and squad oversight
- squad_commander: Squad-level training coordination
- instructor: Training session management and scoring
- soldier: Basic training participation

Permission Inheritance Chain:
```
owner
  └─ commander
       └─ squad_commander
            └─ instructor
                 └─ soldier
```

Access Control Implementation:
- Role-based route protection
- Hierarchical data access filters
- Command chain validation

- Training program access restrictions

Command Chain Rules:
- Orders flow down through hierarchy
- Reports flow up through chain
- Cross-squad actions require commander approval
- Squad integrity maintenance
- Role transition validation

The system implements strict military command structure principles with hierarchical permission inheritance and clear organizational boundaries. Access control follows traditional military chain of command with specialized rules for training management and performance tracking.
