Military-style hierarchical permission system with strictly defined roles and access levels:

## Role Hierarchy
1. Owner (Top Level)
   - Full system access
   - Can modify all roles below
   - Organization management capabilities
   - Importance Score: 95/100

2. Commander
   - Team-wide training management
   - Can modify squad commander and soldier roles
   - Access to all team analytics
   - Importance Score: 85/100

3. Squad Commander

   - Importance Score: 80/100

4. Soldier (Base Level)

   - Individual performance tracking
   - Limited team view access
   - Importance Score: 70/100

## Permission Implementation 
Key paths: components/organization/TeamsSection.tsx, services/roleService.ts

Core permission rules:
- Higher ranks can modify/manage lower ranks only
- Squad-based organization with strict hierarchy
- Role-specific training capabilities
- Team-specific calendar and resource access
- Session management restrictions by role level

Color-coding system for visual role identification:
- Owner: Deep Blue (#003366)
- Commander: Dark Red (#660000)
- Squad Commander: Forest Green (#006600)
- Soldier: Standard Gray (#444444)

Team Management Controls:
- Role assignment validation
- Squad membership constraints
- Training schedule access levels
- Performance metrics visibility

## Critical Business Rules
1. Single-root organization structure
2. Hierarchical command chain for approvals
3. Squad-based member organization
4. Role-specific training coordination rights
5. Specialized notification routing by rank
