# training-session-model

The training session model implements specialized tracking of shooting drills and progression states:

## Core Session States
1. Training Session Management (Importance: 90)
- States: planned, ongoing, completed, cancelled
- Supports dual-mode drills: grouping and achievement targets
- Tracks drill completion criteria including rounds fired, accuracy thresholds
- Validates time limits and required shooting positions

2. Drill Progression System (Importance: 85)
- Maps sequential drill requirements and dependencies 
- Enforces drill prerequisites and unlocking conditions
- Tracks performance metrics per drill type
- Manages drill template configurations and parameters

3. Session Validation Workflows (Importance: 80)
- Enforces completion requirements per drill type:
  - Grouping: Shot dispersion metrics
  - Achievement: Accuracy percentages and hit counts
- Validates time constraints and position requirements
- Processes drill-specific scoring rules

## Session Statistics
- Real-time progress calculations against requirements
- Aggregated completion rates across drill sequences
- Distance-based performance categorization
- Achievement vs grouping success ratios

## Data Models
1. TrainingSession
- status: SessionStatus
- drillProgression: DrillProgress[]
- completionMetrics: CompletionStats
- validationRules: ValidationConfig

2. DrillProgress
- drillType: 'grouping' | 'achievement'
- requirements: DrillRequirements
- completionState: CompletionState
- validationResults: ValidationResult[]

The model emphasizes strict progression tracking and validation workflows specific to firearms training scenarios, with particular focus on different drill types and their completion criteria.
