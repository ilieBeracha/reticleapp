Training Session Data Model Components:

1. Session Lifecycle Management (Importance: 95/100)
Path: components/training-detail/hooks/useTrainingActions.ts
- Implements strict state machine for training sessions:
  * PLANNED -> LIVE -> COMPLETED
  * PLANNED -> CANCELLED
  * LIVE -> SUSPENDED -> LIVE
  * LIVE -> TERMINATED
- Each transition requires validation of:
  * Required participants present
  * Equipment availability
  * Range conditions met
  * Commander authorization

2. Drill Progression Tracking (Importance: 90/100)
Path: components/session/TargetDetailModal.tsx
- Enforces sequential drill completion requirements:
  * Qualification drills must follow prescribed order
  * Training drills allow flexible sequencing
  * Tactical drills require scenario completion validation
- Tracks individual and team completion status
- Manages drill-specific scoring metrics
- Enforces retry limits based on drill type

3. Session Validation System (Importance: 85/100)
Path: components/insights/hooks/useInsightsData.ts
- Validates session completion criteria:
  * Minimum required rounds fired
  * Target acquisition requirements met
  * Time constraints satisfied
  * Safety protocols followed
- Generates completion certificates
- Records qualification achievements
- Tracks certification expiration

4. Training Data Collection (Importance: 80/100)
Path: components/session/ResultCard.tsx
- Captures structured training metrics:
  * Shot grouping measurements
  * Target acquisition times
  * Reaction speeds
  * Accuracy percentages
- Links biometric data to training performance
- Tracks environmental conditions
- Records equipment configurations

5. Progress Tracking Model (Importance: 75/100)
Path: components/training-detail/ProgressTracker.tsx
- Implements multi-level progression system:
  * Individual skill levels
  * Team qualification status
  * Certification requirements
  * Refresher training schedules
- Manages prerequisite requirements
- Tracks continuing education credits
- Handles qualification renewals
