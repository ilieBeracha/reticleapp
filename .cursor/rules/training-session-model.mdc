Core Training Session Model Implementation

1. Session State Machine (Importance Score: 95)
- States: planned -> ongoing -> finished/cancelled
- Validation rules for state transitions
- Required fields per state
- Completion criteria enforcement

2. Drill Progress Tracking (Importance Score: 90) 
- Individual drill completion status
- Accuracy requirements validation
- Time-based completion rules
- Sequential progression enforcement

3. Session Types
- Paper Target Training
  - Group size calculations
  - Shot pattern analysis
  - Distance-based scoring
- Tactical Training
  - Stage completion tracking
  - Hit/miss ratio requirements
  - Time-based performance metrics

4. Validation Rules
- Minimum accuracy thresholds
- Maximum completion times
- Required drill sequences
- Participant prerequisites

5. Core Data Model
```
TrainingSession {
  id: string
  status: SessionStatus
  type: SessionType
  startTime: DateTime
  endTime: DateTime?
  drills: DrillProgress[]
  participants: Participant[]
  requirements: CompletionRequirements
  metrics: SessionMetrics
}
```

6. Progress Tracking
- Per-participant completion status
- Drill sequence validation
- Cumulative accuracy calculations
- Time-based performance metrics

Key Business Rules:
- Sessions must follow planned -> ongoing -> finished progression
- Drills must be completed in defined sequence
- Minimum accuracy requirements per drill type
- Maximum time limits for tactical drills
- Required participant roles for group sessions
