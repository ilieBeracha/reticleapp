# training-session-model

## Core Session Model Components

1. Session State Management
- Priority-based session states: active > scheduled > unresolved > default
- Complex state transitions between personal and team sessions
- Session origin tracking (solo vs team) with metadata
- Unified timeline generation from multiple session types
Importance Score: 90

2. Session Mapping Logic
- Training event to scheduled session mapping
- Business rules for session state classification
- Origin tracking and metadata management
- Complex session batching for stats aggregation
Importance Score: 85

3. Session Analytics
- Multi-dimensional progress tracking:
  - Accuracy metrics
  - Shot patterns and grouping
  - Target engagement timing
  - Performance trends across sessions
- Streak preservation rules with timezone handling
Importance Score: 80

4. Session Validation Workflows
- Training scheduling validation enforcing business rules
- Custom drill instance parameter validation
- State transition rules (planned → ongoing → finished/cancelled)
- Parameter locking system for active sessions
Importance Score: 75

## Key Business Rules

1. Session Type Classification
- Live Fire Qualification
- CQB Tactics Training
- Range Training
- Tactical Drills

2. Progress Tracking Requirements
- Completion status monitoring
- Duration tracking
- Drill progression validation
- Team vs individual performance metrics

3. Session State Transitions
- Strict scheduling validation
- Parameter locking during active state
- Completion criteria verification
- Team synchronization requirements
